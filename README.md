# Self Ordering Kiosk 

## Description 
This is a **FullStack MERN Web Application** which demonstrates the use of a self ordering kiosk which can be used outside fastfood restaurants like McDonalds. This application makes it easy for customers to -
- Browse through the menu 
- Select their order items 
- Review their order
- Proceed to payment 
- Check order status
    
This application also provides an Admin Dashboard for the restaurant workers to confirm or cancel orders which is then reflected in the order queue screen for the customers to see.
